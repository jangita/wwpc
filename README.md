# UnSplash Wallpaper Changer for Windows
This works to get you a pretty wallpaper every hour. A random image is pulled from unsplash. Born out of frustratingly looking for a simple application that can change my windows wallpaper every hour (every day is too long and I hate bloatware and branded wallpapers etc. etc. etc.- sorry Bing!)

## Installation
Download from here 

<https://jangita.io/wwpc-setup-2020-09-10.exe> 

and double click to install. You'll know it worked if you wallpaper magically changes after you install.

## Usage

Just wait for an hour every hour 😊

If you want to change the wallpaper on demand, just open your task scheduler and look for "Windows wallpaper changer" and right click, then click run.

## To Uninstall

In the windows add/remove programs, you'll see windows wallpaper installer. Just double click to uninstall.

## Contributing

Maybe build better installer?
Add tray icon to run on demand?
Have a way to customize how long before changing wallpaper?
Add monochrome mode? (URL supports it...)
Add feature so that it can make coffee?

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request 😁
