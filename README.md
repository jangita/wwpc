# UnSplash Wallpaper Changer for Windows [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jangita/wwpc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jangita/wwpc)

This works to get you a pretty wallpaper every hour. A random image is pulled from unsplash. Born out of frustratingly looking for a simple application that can change my windows wallpaper every hour (every day is too long and I hate bloatware and branded wallpapers etc. etc. etc.- sorry Bing!)

## Installation
Download from here 

<https://github.com/jangita/wwpc/releases/download/v2020.09.26/wwpc-setup-2020-09-26.exe> 

and double click to install. You'll know it worked if you wallpaper magically changes after you install.

## Usage

Just wait for an hour every hour üòä

If you want to change the wallpaper on demand, just open your task scheduler and look for "Windows wallpaper changer" and right click, then click run.

## To Uninstall

In the windows add/remove programs, you'll see windows wallpaper installer. Just double click to uninstall.
